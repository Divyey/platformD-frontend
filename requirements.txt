# # You'll need React, React Router v6, axios, and optionally React Query + Zustand (recommended):
# npm install react react-dom react-router-dom@6 axios

# # Optional but highly recommended (for efficient data fetching & global state):
# npm install @tanstack/react-query zustand

# # To also install dev dependencies:
# npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react
